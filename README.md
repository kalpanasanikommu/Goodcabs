## Goodcabs Transportation trends and Insights
Domain:  Transportation & Mobility 
Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in the Indian market by focusing on tier-2 cities. Unlike other cab service providers, Goodcabs is committed to supporting local drivers, helping them make a sustainable living in their hometowns while ensuring excellent service to passengers. With operations in ten tier-2 cities across India, Goodcabs has set ambitious performance targets for 2024 to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction. 

As part of this initiative, the Goodcabs management team aims to assess the company’s performance across key metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers.
